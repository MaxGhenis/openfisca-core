# These are dependencies to serve the Web-API, so we always want to support
# the latest versions.
#
# As a safety measure, compatibility could be smoke-tested automatically:

#
# In the meantime, we pin these dependencies.

# For OpenFisca's Web API.
flask == 1.1.2
gunicorn == 20.1.0

# For OpenFisca's Web API users requiring CORS.
